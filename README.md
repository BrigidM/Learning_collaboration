## Learning_collaboration
This is a repository to act like the main repository in a collaborative project so that I am able to simultaneously take the role of project manager and contributor.

These are some of the topics I want to cover
* workflow between local repo, repo on personal GitHub account, repo on other person's GitHub account
* how to keep in sync with the main project repo

So far I think that I am getting the idea of a workflow like this
Login to your own GitHub account
Search for and go to the external account and repo that you want to contribute to
Fork a copy of the external repo to your GitHub account
Open GitBash in the directory you want your local repo to reside in
Clone a copy of your forked repo to your local directory

make a new fork for changes you want to make i.e. fix bug1 
when finished open master fork of your local repo and fetch upstream so as to bring in any changes made recently
Now not sure from this point.
